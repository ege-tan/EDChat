# EDChat

EDChat is a messaging extension built in Xcode that enables encrypted conversations with dynamic security. The encryption algorithm changes daily, ensuring continuous protection against interception.

Key Features:

  1-Daily Algorithm Rotation: The encryption scheme updates every 24 hours for enhanced security.

  2-Secondary Security Layer: A three-number passcode system activates an additional encryption algorithm, adding an extra layer of protection.

  3-Seamless Integration: Designed for easy integration into iOS applications as a secure messaging add-on.

This project prioritizes privacy and security, making it an excellent solution for encrypted communication on iOS devices.
